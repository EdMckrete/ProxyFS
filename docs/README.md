## Installation

This directory contains .uml files that are used as input to PlantUML (http://plantuml.com).

PlantUML produces .png files which can then be displayed.

The .png files illustrate the architecture of certain operations such as a bimodal PUT operation.

You can download plantuml.jar from http://plantuml.com/

Then do something like:

    # java -jar plantuml.jar read.uml

This will produce a correspondingly named .png file you can display.
